// Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
// This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.
// A command object represents an instruction to perform a particular action. Contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken.
// Uses: GUI commands, multi-level undo/redo, macro recording and more.
// Commands can be processed by the object upon which it performs its action, by itself or by another processor object (service)
